A system architecture using **openMHA** is proposed which exploits adaptive spatial filtering techniques to create real-time steerable beamformers that are useful in isolating the source of a desired signal from unwanted background noise. The system utilises head tracking orientations to adaptively steer, while controlled by a cross-platform graphical user interface made using **JUCE**.
