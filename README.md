Welcome to the github repo holding the development of my work site. 
All effects, transitions and components built from scratch.

 - SPA designed personally using Figma and Photoshop.
 - Created in Javascript via React.JS
 - Animations made using CSS and Framer Motion.

**Notable work:**

> *The responsive navbar and menu button animations. They took way too long, but are very slick.*

### Todo:

 - Improve SEO (Layout Shift, Blocking Time).
 - Improve image loading efficiency.

Front-End is built on React and tailwind.
Back-end storage handled via Firestore.
